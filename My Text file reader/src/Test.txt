Definition and Usage
The download attribute specifies that the target will be downloaded when a user clicks on the hyperlink.

This attribute is only used if the href attribute is set.

The value of the attribute will be the name of the downloaded file. There are no restrictions on allowed values, and the browser will automatically detect the correct file extension and add it to the file (.img, .pdf, .txt, .html, etc.).

If the value is omitted, the original filename is used.

Browser Support
The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports the attribute.

* Chrome 65+ and Firefox only support same-origin download links.

Differences Between HTML 4.01 and HTML5
The download attribute is new for the <a> tag in HTML5.
